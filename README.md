# QR_PROJEC
This project involves the creation of a Python-based application that can generate QR codes from text input (like URLs or other information) and also scan and decode QR codes. The project utilizes libraries like qrcode for generating QR codes and opencv (or pyzbar) for scanning and decoding QR codes.

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the process of creating and scanning QR codes, making it easier to share information, such as URLs, contact details, and payment information, in a secure and convenient way. QR codes are widely used in various applications like online payments, marketing, product information, and authentication processes.
